Installation
============

Windows
-------

On Windows, using the official Windows installation program is recommended.
If you want to build your own installer, see :ref:`win32_installer`.

Install on OSX
--------------

On OSX, using the official OSX installation DMG is recommended. See
:ref:`osx_notes`

If you want to build your own installer, see :ref:`osx_installer`.

Linux/*nix
----------

On *nix-based systems (but not OSX), run the following to install::

    $ make
    # make install

The "make" step is optional and only compiles the modules and translations.

There is also an install_no_locale target if you wish to install without
translations.
