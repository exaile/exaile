class ExaileEngine(object):
    '''
        Interface that the ExailePlayer uses to control the engines. Other
        parts of Exaile should never interact directly with the engines, but
        interact with the ExailePlayer instead.

        Engines should not call play/stop/pause/unpause on itself directly,
        should call through the player object instead.

        All public functions are assumed to be called from the Glib main
        thread, or bad things will happen.

        The ExailePlayer object provides a common API that engines must use
        to indicate the current playback status, or retrieve things such as
        the next track to be played.

        Player API: Playback status:

        * engine_notify_track_start: Called when a track begins playback
        * engine_notify_track_end: Called when a track has stopped playing
        * engine_notify_error: Call this to notify the user of an error

        Player API: Auto-advance

        * engine_autoadvance_get_next_track: Call this to determine whether
          a new track should be played after the current track
        * engine_autoadvance_notify_next: Call when the auto advance track is
          actually played.

        Player API: misc

        * engine_notify_user_volume_change: Call this when something inside
          of the engine causes the user volume to change.

        Engines are expected to honor the value of the __startoffset and
        __stopoffset flags to start/stop tracks at the appropriate offsets.
