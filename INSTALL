To install:

  $ make
  # make install

The "make" step is optional and only compiles the modules, translations, and the
mmkeys extension.

There is also an install_no_locale target if you wish to install without 
translations.



Environment variables that affect "make install":

  LIBINSTALLDIR
    The lib directory to be appended to PREFIX. 
    Default: /lib
  PREFIX
    The installation prefix. 
    Default: /usr/local
    Note: If this default is changed, you may need to set the XDG_DATA_DIRS
      environment variable to include the changed path. See [1].
  XDGCONFDIR
    The directory to install system-wide config files in, following xdg spec. 
    Default: /etc/xdg 
    Note: If this default is changed, you may need to set the XDG_CONFIG_DIRS 
      environment variable to include the changed path. See [1].
  DESTDIR
    Destination directory to put the file structure under. Mainly of use for
      packagers.
    Default: not set (/)
