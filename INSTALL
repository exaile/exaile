Installation
============

Windows
-------

On Windows, using the official Windows installation program is recommended.
If you want to build your own installer, see :ref:`win32_installer`.

Install on OSX
--------------

On OSX, using the official OSX installation DMG is recommended. See
:ref:`osx_notes`

If you want to build your own installer, see :ref:`osx_installer`.

Linux/*nix
----------

On *nix-based systems (but not OSX), run the following command from the
source code directory to install::

    $ make
    # make install

The "make" step is optional and only compiles the modules and translations.

There is also an install_no_locale target if you wish to install without
translations.

To uninstall exaile please run

    # make uninstall

from the same directory.

Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note: normally it should be enough to set PREFIX, and potentially LIBINSTALLDIR
on a 64-bit system.  The additional variables can provide further installation
customization.

Environment variables that affect "make install":

  LIBINSTALLDIR
    The full path to the lib directory.
    Default: EPREFIX/lib
  DATADIR
    The full path to non-arcitecture dependent data files.
    Default: PREFIX/share
  MANPREFIX
    The full path to the parent of the man page installation directory (same
    as system DATADIR)
    Default: PREFIX/share
  EPREFIX
    The executable installation prefix.
    Default: PREFIX
  PREFIX
    The main installation prefix.
    Default: /usr/local
    Note: If this default is changed, you may need to set the LIBINSTALLDIR or
      XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variables to include the changed path. See [1].
  XDGCONFDIR
    The directory to install system-wide config files in, following xdg spec.
    Default: /etc/xdg 
    Note: If this default is changed, you may need to set the XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
      environment variable to include the changed path. See [1].
  DESTDIR
    Destination directory to put the file structure under. Mainly of use for
      packagers.
    Default: not set (/)
  DEFAULTARGS
    Default arguments that the 'exaile' launcher script (installed to
    $PREFIX/bin/exaile) will pass to exaile on startup
