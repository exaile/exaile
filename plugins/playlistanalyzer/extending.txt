Add your own analysis
=====================

The playlist analyzer plugin reads from the templates directory and provides 
those as output options to the user. The user is given a choice of tags to
output.

This format is experimental and highly subject to change.

Meta tags
---------

<meta name="name" content="display name" />

This provides the name of the template to display to the user.

<meta name="description" content="description of layout">

This provides a description of the template to the user.
	
<meta name="mintags" content="1" />
<meta name="maxtags" content="1" />

Number of tags this layout supports.

Template data
-------------

The data is written as specified by the user in the following form:

	data = [
		[tag1, ... tagN],	# first track
		...					# second, etc
	]
	
The grouping tag will be written out as a list of tags.
	
	
Template insertion
------------------

The plugin treats the template as a giant string, and uses python format
string functionality to substitute data into the template. 

- Anything with a % in it should be %%
- The following special strings will be substituted

    - %(data)s              - The data as JSON (see above for format)
    - %(title)s             - User defined title
    - %(tagdata)s           - A list of tuples of tagname, extra
    - %(playlist_names)s    - A list of the playlists included

The included report types only begin to scratch the surface of what's
available. If you have ideas for other types of useful analysis that 
could be done on playlists, implement it and submit a patch to the exaile
project on Launchpad.
