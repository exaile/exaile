    """Helper to make D-Bus handling more Pythonic.

    The `object` argument of the constructor should be a Python object in the
    following form:

        class Object:
            def MyMethod(self, arg1, arg2):
                return GLib.Variant('s', 'out1'), GLib.Variant('s', 'out2')
            @property
            def MyProperty(self):
                return GLib.Variant('i', 0)
            @MyProperty.setter
            def MyProperty(self, value):
                pass

    You can then set the `method_call`, `get_property`, and `set_property`
    methods as the callbacks for the D-Bus object (i.e. the last three
    arguments in `DBusConnection.register_object`).

    The methods and property setters receive their arguments as `GLib.Variant`s
    and must still create a `GLib.Variant` for each return value.

    A Python method or property is exported if the name starts with an
    uppercase character and does not end with `_`.
    Attributes which are neither methods nor properties are not exported.
