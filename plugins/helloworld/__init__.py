    If you don't care about whether the UI/exaile have finished loading,
    you can create a plugin by implementing the following functions:

        def enable(exaile):
            print("Hello, world!")
            testlib.success()

        def disable(exaile):
            print("Goodbye. :(")

        def teardown(exaile):
            # optional function
            print("Unhello, World!")

    Exaile 3.4 introduced a new way to write plugins which will eliminate
    a lot of unnecessary boilerplate for plugin authors.

    New-style plugins must have a variable in the module that is
    called 'plugin_class', which is a Python object with the following
    interface:

    class Foo:

        def enable(self, exaile):
            pass

        def disable(self, exaile):
            pass

    The object can also have the following optional functions:

        def on_gui_loaded(self):
            - This will be called when the GUI is ready, or
              immediately if already done

        def on_exaile_loaded(self):
            - This will be called when exaile is done loading, or
              immediately if already done

        def teardown(self, exaile):
            - This will be called when exaile is unloading

    Note that the old style of writing plugins is not going away, so you
    can continue to write plugins that way if its simpler.
