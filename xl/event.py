Provides a signals-like system for sending and listening for 'events'


Events are kind of like signals, except they may be listened for on a
global scale, rather than connected on a per-object basis like signals
are. This means that ANY object can emit ANY event, and these events may
be listened for by ANY object.

Events should be emitted AFTER the given event has taken place. Often the
most appropriate spot is immediately before a return statement.
